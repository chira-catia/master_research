While the simulators investigated in this paper are very useful, we believe
that there is room for improvement. Most of them are generic simulators
adapted for simulating wireless sensor networks. We believe that a simulator
built from the begining having in mind that it will be used for wireless
sensors will increase its usability and make it possible that it will be
useful in more circumstances.

We propose this general plan for building this simulator:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Component architecture and basic node structure. We will build
  template components and create the necessary framework to integrate them
  into a sensor node.
  \item Comunication between nodes. Create the neccessary framework to make
  two nodes communicate.
  \item Implement some routing procols. To evaluate our simulator we will
  implement some routing procols(LEACH, TEEN) in it and see it's performance
  \item Environment simulation. Will augment the simulator with environment
  simulation as described in the paper.
\end{itemize}
