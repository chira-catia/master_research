In this paper we report our research on some existing wireless network
simulators, namely NS-2, J-sim and TOSSIM and introduce \codename the 
wireless network simulator which we will develop hereafter, presenting its 
features and going into details regarding the architectural design and implementation.

All the surveyed simulators were not intended from the beginning to be
used for WSN simulations but rather modified later in order to simulate WNSs, 
\codename is to be used only 
for WSNs simulations, its design and
implementation being focused on taking the best decision for an accurate WSN
simulation. It will benefit from the experience of the already implemented
simulators using some of their key features and improving some others, but
it will also bring new features.
