In the previous section we presented three WSN simulators commonly used and 
found that neither NS-2 nor J-Sim were designed especially for wireless 
sensor network simulators but that the basic applications needed to be extended
in prder to offer support for WSN simulations, whereas TOSSIM is especially designed
for the Berkeley Mica Mote platform.
