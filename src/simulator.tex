In the previous section we presented three WSN simulators commonly used.
\\
    Both NS-2 and J-Sim were not designed especially for wireless 
sensor network simulators but the basic applications were extended
in order to support WSN simulations; TOSSIM was especially designed
for the Berkeley Mica Mote platform and aims to simulate rather TinyOS's behavior
than general sensors. Even though they provide a good simulation environment,
we believe a simulator targeted for wireless sensors will offer better results
and take into consideration more of the particularities a WSN has.
\\
    Simulators are mainly used for research purposes, and if some tested solution
offers good results it is very likely that it will be eventually ported on 
read-world devices. The less effort needs to be invested in this porting, the
better. Of the three simulators presented, nesC TOSSIM code is the easiest to port,
but only on TinyOS motes, C/C++ NS-2 code can be ported as well but at a higher
cost whereas Java J-Sim's code cannot be ported but the solution should be 
reimplemented in a programming language that can be run on sensors.
\codename will be written in C with a declared purpose of being very easy to port
on real-world sensors.
\\
All three presented simulators lack detailed environment modeling: J-Sim has 
antenna component to model signal transmissions and TOSSIM provides a configuration
file to define the probability that a sent bit will be received corrupted. 
 none of them
being capable of 3D indoor simulation without modification.
