In this paper we will present some of the existing Wireless Network
Simulators emphasizing what we believe to be their strenghts and weaknesses. 
In section NS-2 we discuss about NS-2 simulator, in section J-sim we present
J-sim and then we take a look at TOSSIM simulator. Based on these observations
we introduce in section \codename the WSN simulator we will implement which
encompasses most of these simulators' strenghts .
