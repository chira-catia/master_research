A large number of simulators exist to help research evaluate the behaviour of
wireless sensor networks. Some of this are general network simulators, like NS-2,
which has been adapted using modules to the area of wireless network simulators, others
where built especially for this use. There are also emulator of sensor nodes which can be
used to simulate network of small to medium size. Of these, we will take a look at NS-2, J-Sim
and TOSSIM.
