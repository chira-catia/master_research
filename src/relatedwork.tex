Simulators come with a great advantage over real network devices that is the 
possibility of constructing very complex topologies in a short time at a much lower 
cost. Simulators have a very similar behaviour to real-world topologies thus being 
a perfect tool for educational and research purposes. 
\\
A large number of simulators exist to help researchers evaluate the behaviour of
wireless sensor networks. Some of these are general network simulators, like NS-2,
which has been adapted using modules to the area of wireless network simulators, others
were built especially for this use. There are also emulatora of sensor nodes which can be
used to simulate networka of small to medium size. Out of these, we will take a look at NS-2, 
J-Sim and TOSSIM.
