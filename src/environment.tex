Wireless sensor network are deployed in a wide range of environments. This affects
the away the routing protocols perform and the way hierarchies are formed. An indoor
environment for example means that the nodes will have to use more power to transmit
packets which will lead to lower battery life. We think it is important to be able to
see how this protocols behave in a real environment. This will be very important for
mobile nodes, which can change their location, as simple attenuation based design will
not be able to simulate realistically the effects of the environment on power needed to
transmit.

Environments will be designed in Blender, a 3D graphics tool, from which they will be
exported to our simulator using its extensive scripting support.
