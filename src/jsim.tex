\label{subsec:jsim}
J-sim\footnote {original web site \url{http://j-sim.cs.uiuc.edu/}, moving to 
\url{http://sites.google.com/site/jsimofficial/}} is not a network simulator
by itself, but a component based development environment. Component based
development focuses on separation of concerns between the different subsystems
of a software system. In term of a wireless sensor node it means that only 
battery will be in charge of the flow of electrecity through the system.
This approach tries to mimic an integrated circuit. On top of the framework 
provided by J-Sim, a wireless network simulator has been built.
